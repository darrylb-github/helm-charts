# rbac

This helm chart allows you to list roles and/or rolebindings in a values.yaml file and have them created as part of a helm release to a cluster in the given namespace.

See [user-facing-roles](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles) for built in roles that can be used.
